                <p>If we are talking about the numbers we can say that only in the USA flag football is played by more
                    than 1 million kids! And solely in Europe, we have around 600 clubs, in Slovenia alone, we have 8
                    flag football teams. And we hope the number will rise in the next few years.</p>
